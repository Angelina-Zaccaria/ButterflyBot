# Reflection

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?

I found the use cases, sequence flow, and storyboard to all be very useful. The use cases allowed us to determine what we wanted to accomplish with our project. It allowed us to break down what users would do, which made it beneficial when we moved to the implementation of the code since we were able to follow our use case flows in order to implement the functionality we wanted users to perform. Additionally, the sequence flow was helpful since it allowed us to view a high level of what we aimed at accomplshing. Our story board included all functionality that we wanted to include for the project, therefore having this allowed us to view how we imaged the different functionalities to work. Lastly, the sequence flow was helpful since it allowed us to break down the flow of users and the functions they could perform. This allowed us to breakdown the connection of the different elements/ the order of flow for the processes. This helped us to have a guideline of what we exepcted from the code.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I found making the architecture design most difficult as it was my first time creating/dealing with architecture design. I found it difficult to breakdown the architecture into a diagram. I wasn't familair with slack or bots, which made it even more difficult for me to be able to create this diagram. Additionally, I did not find this as useful as other design methods since when creating the code functionality, I relied on the other designs that we had created. What I would would differently would be to gain more knowledge in the area of architecture design. Even though I did do research in order to complete this, I would have tried to gain more knowledge on a deeper level rather than on a surface level if I was to go back and had more time.

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

I would try the use cases, seuence slow, and storyboard again in the future as I found these to be very helpful/ beneficial. I referred back to these designs often throguhout my process in order to reiterate what we had envisioned/ to see if I was on the right track as far as how I was impementing the different flows for the different functionality. Utilizing these methods allowed for a smoother implemenetation, therefore I would definitely use them again.

### Implementation

1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?

I found that implementing, testing, and integtaion were helpful in allowing us to connect different parts and functionality into one. Integration was helpful in the sense that we were able to have different team emmebrs work on different parts, but then integrate these parts together to function as a single unit. I found integration helpful in bringing everything togther. Testing was helpful since it allowed us to find issues and vulnerabilities within our code. Testing allowed us to determine these problems before they were deployed and casued issues for the users.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I found implementing the bot to be most difficult as I had no prior knowledge with this. It was a very steep learning curve for me, therefore it took me a while to understand how bot's can be implemeneted as well as how to actually implement them. Additionally, the classic bot did not allow my team to implement all of the functionality that we had orginailly hoped, so it was a bit difficult to have to work around this and create what we wanted in different ways. What I would do differently is create another bot instead of the classic bot so that we could implement all fuctionalty that we had desired. I would have done deeper research into what functionality different bots provide so that my group could implement a bot that would have been easier to understand, as well as allow us to not have limitations in what we could do.

3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

As far as mplementation I would definitely use topcoder again in the future. I am very familiar with SQL due to past Co-op experience and tend to perfer the use of SQL when utilizing databases. Topcoder allowed us to use SQL which made it easy to deal with our data as well as store and pull information from the database. I have never used Topcoder before, but due to its ease of use it is definitely something that I would continue using. In terms of testing and integration, I feel that my team broke down the project into parts and integrated and tested these parts well. We tested the functionality of each part as we completed it, which I feel allowed us to catch small errors earlier rather than finding larger errors when all parts were integrated together. In the future I would definitely continue to integrate and test in small parts, as well as perform continuous testing as we moved along.

### Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?

I feel that the kanban board was extremely helpful in terms of allowing my team to stay on track and see what had to be done, what was in progress, and what had to be completed. The kanban board provided us with structure, which I feel was extremely helpful. We were able to add the items that we had to do in order to ensure that we wouldn't forget about these, as well as remind us what had to be done. Additionally, it was helpful to see what was in progress and completed so that our team members could focus on different areas that we could assign instead of both working on the same area withouut knowing. I additionally found code reviews helpful since they allowed for all of our team members to be constantly up to date as well as give team members the opportunity to recieve help from other members on things that they may have needed.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

I found utilizng Git branching to be most difficult due to my lack of experience in the area. I often had trouble with commits conflicting and therefore spent a lot of time fixing code/ ensuring that my code wouldn't break when trying to merge the different branches. This was something that was very new to me so what I would have done differently was probably created less branches that had more purpose rather than creating many branches that had small commits, so that I was able to learn branching better and use it as more of a purpose rather than trying to utilize its functonality that I wasn't as comfortable with.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

In the future, I would definitely utilize kanban, code reviews, git issues, and wiki on the repo. The kanban board was extrememly helpful in viewing our progress as well as the tasks that had to be completed/ were completed. The code reviews allowed every member to remain up to date. The git issues allowed us to create tasks that had to be completed and assign team memebrs to these tasks. This allowed us to ensure that no issue was forgotten about and that every issue would be covered. The wiki on git allowed our team to store meeting notes that we could go back to. Due to the functionality of all of these, they are definitely something I would utilize in the futre.

### Overall

Overall, I really enjoyed this project. There were a lot of aspects that were new to me, which I feel allowed me to grow my knowledge within software engineeing. I was able to lean new design, implentation, and process methods that I feel will really be able to benefit me in my future. I additionally learned a lot more about GitHub, which I feel will help me greatly since GitHub is so widely used. I feel that my knowledge has been extremely expanded, which can be seen by our project progress.
