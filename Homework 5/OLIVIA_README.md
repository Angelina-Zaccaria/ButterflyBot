# Reflection

### Design
1. What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
I found writing out our use cases to be the most helpful part when wokring with my group to outline our design methods. The use cases were helpful to me because it allowed me to understand what we were trying to accomplish at a high level and the necessary steps that would follow the task, as well as subflows and alternate flows that would disrupt the natural progression. I felt that this practice aided me when it came time to code the project because understanding how the user would interact with the bot signifigantly simplified what exactly we needed to implement.
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
I found it most difficult to envision and write out our architecture design when writing out our design methods. This was the msot difficult for me because I had no prior experience working with bots before this project so I was very ensure what designs were possible and best for the project we set out to implement. If given the opportunity to do this section differently I would talk to classmates with bot experience to get their advice as well as do research into popular architecture designs for bots.
3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
In the future, I would choose to implement the following design methods: use cases, sequence flow diagrams, and storyboarding. I found that all of these methods helped deepen my understanding of our groups project as well as made the implementation of the bot easier to execute.

### Implementation
1. What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
I found it most helpful to use the extensive online resources when integrating our desired features. Given that this was the first bot I have ever implemented, the internet was a great source of learning for me and played a signifigant role in aiding me in integrating our desired features. Additionally, using Visual Studio Code as our code editor really helped when it caming to testing thanks to their terminal and debug console features.
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
I found it most difficult to implement a slackbot. Given the scope of the project we had to implement a classic bot, which in turn limited our options. In the future, I would choose to implement a discord bot because I saw the ease my classmates had while implementing their discord bots as well as the ease to implement a discord bot within the scope of the project.
3. What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
In the future, I would continue to use a topcoder database, given the ease to query and upload tables to the database. Additionally, I will continue to use Visual Studio Code as my coding environment.

### Process
1. What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
I found the most helpful part about implementing kanban and code review into the project was the ability to visualize the tasks that were completed as well as the tasks that still needed to be completed. Additionally, it helped to assign tasks among the members in the group to avoid confusion.
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
I found it most difficult to implement branching as a form of code review. I found this most difficult because it is a new practice to me, but I would like to continue practicing it and would choose not to do anything differently.
3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
In the future I would like to continue to document project notes within the wiki of the repo, utilize the kanban board to visualize the progression of the project board, and practice branching as a form of code review and to ensure pushing to the master branch would not cause issues.

### Overall
Overall, I believe this was a successful project when combining all the features and tools learned throughout this process. I found what helped me most on this project was the signifigant documentation the group produced. Across the design, implementation, and process steps of the project the documentation we found through research and produced ourselves proved to be beneficial. Each piece of documentation served a unique purpose from the design methods we wrote out to implementation of branching as form of code review. However, when all these forms of documentation came together, I believe the large amount that we produced speaks to the overall quality of the project we produced.
